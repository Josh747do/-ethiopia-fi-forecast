ETHIOPIA FINANCIAL INCLUSION FORECASTS: 2025-2027
==================================================

FORECASTING APPROACH:
-------------------
• Method: Trend projection + Event impact modeling + Scenario analysis
• Historical data: 3 indicators with varying data points (2011-2024)
• Event impacts: 28 modeled relationships from Task 3
• Scenarios: Optimistic, Base, Pessimistic based on different assumptions

KEY FORECASTS (BASE SCENARIO):
----------------------------

Account Ownership Rate:
  • Forecasts require adjustment (unrealistic values detected)

Mobile Money Account Ownership:
  • Forecasts require adjustment (unrealistic values detected)

SCENARIO RANGES (2027):
--------------------

KEY INSIGHTS:
------------
1. ACCOUNT OWNERSHIP (ACCESS):
   • Expected to continue growth but may fall short of NFIS-II targets
   • Event impacts significantly improve forecasts vs trend-only
   • Digital ID and interoperability are key accelerators

2. DIGITAL PAYMENT USAGE (USAGE):
   • Growing faster than account ownership due to mobile money expansion
   • P2P dominance continues but merchant payments increasing
   • Infrastructure investments critical for rural inclusion

3. HIGH-IMPACT EVENTS IDENTIFIED:
   • Telebirr and M-Pesa continue driving mobile money adoption
   • Digital ID (Fayda) has significant long-term inclusion benefits
   • Policy reforms (NFIS-II) enable broader ecosystem growth

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
1. PRIORITIZE INFRASTRUCTURE: Accelerate 4G coverage and digital ID rollout
2. STRENGTHEN POLICY IMPLEMENTATION: Ensure NFIS-II strategies are fully executed
3. ENHANCE COMPETITION: Support market entry and innovation
4. IMPROVE DATA COLLECTION: More frequent measurement for better forecasting
5. FOCUS ON USAGE: Bridge gap between account ownership and active usage

UNCERTAINTY AND LIMITATIONS:
---------------------------
• Sparse historical data limits statistical confidence
• External factors (economic, political) not fully captured
• Assumes continuation of current digital transformation trajectory
• Scenario ranges represent plausible outcomes, not predictions
