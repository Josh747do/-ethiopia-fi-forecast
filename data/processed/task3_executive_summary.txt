EVENT IMPACT MODELING - TASK 3 COMPLETION SUMMARY
=================================================

DATE: 2026-02-02
ANALYST: Data Scientist, Selam Analytics

OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED:
------------------
Successfully modeled how events affect financial inclusion indicators in Ethiopia,
creating a robust impact estimation framework for forecasting.

KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
-------------------
1. BUILT EVENT-INDICATOR IMPACT MATRIX
   • 12 events x 5 core indicators = 60 potential impact estimates
   • 28 estimates populated (47% coverage)
   • Visualized as interactive heatmap

2. INTEGRATED COMPARABLE COUNTRY EVIDENCE
   • Database of 4 comparable countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, India)
   • 7 comparable events mapped to Ethiopian context
   • Evidence-based adjustments applied to impact estimates

3. VALIDATED AGAINST HISTORICAL DATA
   • 9 event-indicator pairs validated with historical data
   • Telebirr launch: Key case study with detailed validation
   • Identified systematic underestimation of 1.93pp

4. REFINED IMPACT ESTIMATES
   • Addressed systematic bias through multi-level refinements
   • Reduced mean absolute error from 2.95pp to 1.62pp (45% improvement)
   • Created confidence scoring (High/Medium/Low) with uncertainty ranges

5. COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION
   • Detailed methodology following document requirements
   • All assumptions, limitations, and decisions documented
   • Ready for Task 4 forecasting

CRITICAL INSIGHTS:
-----------------
• Policy events have stronger systemic impacts than initially estimated
• Telebirr's impact on account ownership was significantly underestimated
• Comparable country evidence is essential for data-scarce contexts
• Systematic validation reveals and corrects modeling biases

READY FOR TASK 4:
----------------
The refined event-indicator matrix with confidence scores and uncertainty ranges
is now ready for use in Task 4 forecasting. Key outputs saved to:
• event_indicator_matrix_refined.csv
• impact_confidence_matrix.csv
• event_impact_modeling_methodology.json

NEXT STEPS:
----------
1. Use refined impact matrix to augment trend forecasts
2. Incorporate uncertainty ranges into forecast confidence intervals
3. Develop scenarios based on event impact combinations
4. Build interactive dashboard for stakeholder exploration
